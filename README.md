ðŸš—ðŸš“ðŸ›ºðŸš’ðŸš›ðŸš¦# VANET Scenario Simulation.  
ðŸŒŸThis repository contains a MATLAB simulation for creating a scenario for Vechicular ad-hoc network.  
ðŸš—The goal is to create a real world vechicle dynamic topology and visualize their behavior in realtime traffic.  
âœ¨Have added the codes in run simulation part , while remaining are not posted here, if needed contact me I will share it.  
ðŸŽŠSkills Demonstrated:  
âœ¨MATLAB scripting and simulations.  
âœ¨Developmenet & Analysis.  
For questions or collaboration

ðŸ’¡Purpose of this code :  
To visualize a simulation of dynamic vechicles without VANET.  
ðŸ’¡Use :  
With this we can further proceed on adding Vanet and see how vechicular communication happens with ECU on vechicle.
